# README

## Welcome to Tomâ€™s Rails practice!
Your mission is to recreate this app (you can skip this page) to the best of your ability. Work with your group members to find all the features of this site, and implement them â€” starting with rails new and using the know-how that you've built through the labs. Failing that, error messages, Google, your neighbors, and your instructors can help!

Work through the *entire* Authors controller (finish it!) before you start work on the Books controller. If you want to do your migrations / associations for all your models first, that's fine.

## Some things to think about (in rough order of when you should probably think about them):
<!-- 1. Models and relationships
  - How many books can an author have?
  - How many authors can a book have?
  (Following the links in the header should help you answer these questions! Make your decisions based on the functionality of the app.) -->
<!-- 2. rails g model -->
<!-- 3. Associations -->
4. Routes
  - Authors
  - Books
5. rails g controller
6. Views (if you haven't run rails s yet you should now)
7. Strong Params
8. Validations
9. form.collection_select
10. Nested Routes (this app uses them...somewhere. ðŸ™ƒ You don't have to, but feel free to challenge yourself!)
11. MVC (refactoring...?)
12. before_action (more refactoring...?!?)
